To run, please set the value in app.config

This is where you can place the list of commands in the txt file
    <add key="commandFile" value="C:\Saygin\CSharp\Projects\TestForMott\TestForMott\commands.txt" />

True if all commands myst be in upper case. False if you want to run the commands and the commands need not have to be in uppercase
    <add key="caseSensitiveCommands" value="false" />

Apologies - More unit test can be done but a little tired now to do more
